## AI-generated Key Takeaways

outlined\_flag

* Like sorting good apples from bad, ML engineers spend significant time cleaning data by removing or fixing bad examples to improve dataset quality.
* Common data problems include omitted values, duplicate examples, out-of-range values, and incorrect labels, which can negatively impact model performance.
* You can use programs or scripts to identify and handle data issues such as omitted values, duplicates, and out-of-range feature values by removing or correcting them.
* When multiple individuals label data, it's important to check for consistency and identify potential biases to ensure label quality.
* Addressing data quality issues before training a model leads to better model accuracy and overall performance.

Apple trees produce a mixture of great fruit and wormy messes.
Yet the apples in high-end grocery stores display 100% perfect fruit.
Between orchard and grocery, someone spends significant time removing
the bad apples or spraying a little wax on the salvageable ones.
As an ML engineer, you'll spend enormous amounts of your time
tossing out bad examples and cleaning up the salvageable ones.
Even a few bad apples can spoil a large dataset.

Many examples in datasets are unreliable due to one or more of the
following problems:

| Problem category | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Omitted values | A census taker fails to record a resident's age. |
| Duplicate examples | A server uploads the same logs twice. |
| Out-of-range feature values. | A human accidentally types an extra digit. |
| Bad labels | A human evaluator mislabels a picture of an oak tree as a maple. |

You can write a program or script to detect any of the following problems:

* Omitted values
* Duplicate examples
* Out-of-range feature values

For example, the following dataset contains six repeated values:

![IMAGE: Figure 15. The first six values are repeated. The final eight
values are not.]()

**Figure 15.** The first six values are repeated.

As another example, suppose the temperature range for a certain feature must
be between 10 and 30 degrees, inclusive. But accidents happen—perhaps a
thermometer is temporarily exposed to the sun which causes a bad outlier.
Your program or script must identify temperature values less than 10 or greater
than 30:

![IMAGE: Figure 16. Nineteen in-range values and one out-of-range value.]()

**Figure 16.** An out-of-range value.

When labels are generated by multiple people, we recommend statistically
determining whether each rater generated equivalent sets of labels.
Perhaps one rater was a harsher grader than the other raters or used
a different set of grading criteria?

Once detected, you typically "fix" examples that contain bad features
or bad labels by removing them from the dataset or imputing their values.
