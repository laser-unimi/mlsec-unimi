# Working with categorical data

[**Categorical data**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#categorical-data) has a
*specific set* of possible values. For example:

* The different species of animals in a national park
* The names of streets in a particular city
* Whether or not an email is spam
* The colors that house exteriors are painted
* Binned numbers, which are described in the [Working with Numerical
  Data](/machine-learning/crash-course/numerical-data) module

## Numbers can also be categorical data

True [**numerical data**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#numerical-data)
can be meaningfully multiplied. For example, consider a
model that predicts the value of a house based on its area.
Note that a useful model for evaluating house prices typically relies on
hundreds of features. That said, all else being equal, a house of 200 square
meters should be roughly twice as valuable as an identical house of 100 square
meters.

Oftentimes, you should represent features that contain integer values as
categorical data instead of numerical data. For example, consider a postal
code feature in which the values are integers. If you represent this
feature numerically rather than categorically, you're asking the model
to find a numeric relationship
between different postal codes. That is, you're telling the model to
treat postal code 20004 as twice (or half) as large a signal as postal code
10002. Representing postal codes as categorical data lets the model
weight each individual postal code separately.

## Encoding

**Encoding** means converting categorical or other data to numerical vectors
that a model can train on. This conversion is necessary because models can
only train on floating-point values; models can't train on strings such as
`"dog"` or `"maple"`. This module explains different
encoding methods for categorical data.
