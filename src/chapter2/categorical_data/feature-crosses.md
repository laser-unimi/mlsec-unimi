# Categorical data: Feature crosses

[**Feature crosses**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature-cross) are created by
crossing (taking the Cartesian product of) two or more categorical or bucketed
features of the dataset. Like [polynomial
transforms](/machine-learning/crash-course/numerical-data/polynomial-transforms),
feature crosses allow linear models to handle nonlinearities. Feature crosses
also encode interactions between features.

For example, consider a leaf dataset with the categorical features:

* `edges`, containing values `smooth`, `toothed`, and `lobed`
* `arrangement`, containing values `opposite` and `alternate`

Assume the order above is the order of the feature columns in a one-hot
representation, so that a leaf with `smooth` edges and `opposite` arrangement
is represented as `{(1, 0, 0), (1, 0)}`.

The feature cross, or Cartesian product, of these two features would be:

`{Smooth_Opposite, Smooth_Alternate, Toothed_Opposite, Toothed_Alternate,
Lobed_Opposite, Lobed_Alternate}`

where the value of each term is the product of the base feature values, such
that:

* `Smooth_Opposite = edges[0] * arrangement[0]`
* `Smooth_Alternate = edges[0] * arrangement[1]`
* `Toothed_Opposite = edges[1] * arrangement[0]`
* `Toothed_Alternate = edges[1] * arrangement[1]`
* `Lobed_Opposite = edges[2] * arrangement[0]`
* `Lobed_Alternate = edges[2] * arrangement[1]`

For example, if a leaf has a `lobed` edge and an `alternate` arrangement, the
feature-cross vector will have a value of 1 for `Lobed_Alternate`, and a value
of 0 for all other terms:

`{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}`

This dataset could be used to classify leaves by tree species, since these
characteristics do not vary within a species.

with feature crosses**

Feature crosses are somewhat analogous to
[Polynomial transforms](/machine-learning/crash-course/numerical-data/polynomial-transforms).
Both combine multiple features into a new synthetic feature that the model can
train on to learn nonlinearities. Polynomial transforms typically combine
numerical data, while feature crosses combine categorical data.

## When to use feature crosses

Domain knowledge can suggest a useful combination of features
to cross. Without that domain knowledge, it can be difficult to determine
effective feature crosses or polynomial transforms by hand. It's often possible,
if computationally expensive, to use
[neural networks](/machine-learning/crash-course/neural-networks) to
*automatically* find and apply useful feature combinations during training.

Be careful—crossing two sparse features produces an even sparser new
feature than the two original features. For example, if feature A is a
100-element sparse feature and feature B is a 200-element sparse feature,
a feature cross of A and B yields a 20,000-element sparse feature.
