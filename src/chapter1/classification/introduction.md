# Classification

**Learning objectives**

* Determine an appropriate threshold for a binary classification model.
* Calculate and choose appropriate metrics to evaluate a binary
  classification model.
* Interpret ROC and AUC.
**Prerequisites:**

This module assumes you are familiar with the concepts covered in the
following modules:

In the [Logistic regression module](/chapter1/logistic_regression/intro.html),
you learned how to use the **sigmoid function**
to convert raw model output to a value between 0 and 1 to make probabilistic
predictions—for example, predicting that a given email has a 75% chance of
being spam. But what if your goal is not to output probability but a
category—for example, predicting whether a given email is "spam" or "not spam"?

**Classification** is
the task of predicting which of a set of **classes**
(categories) an example belongs to. In this module, you'll learn how to convert
a logistic regression model that predicts a probability into a
**binary classification**
model that predicts one of two classes. You'll also learn how to
choose and calculate appropriate metrics to evaluate the quality of a
classification model's predictions. Finally, you'll get a brief introduction to
**multi-class classification**
problems, which are discussed in more depth later in the course.
