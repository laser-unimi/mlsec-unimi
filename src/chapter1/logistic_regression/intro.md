# Logistic Regression

**Learning Objectives**

* Identify use cases for performing logistic regression.
* Explain how logistic regression models use the sigmoid function
  to calculate probability.
* Compare linear regression and logistic regression.
* Explain why logistic regression uses log loss instead of squared
  loss.
* Explain the importance of regularization when training logistic
  regression models.

This module introduces a new type of regression model called
[**logistic regression**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#logistic_regression)
that is designed to predict the probability of a given outcome.
